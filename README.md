# Login System

## Project Overview
The Login System is a PHP-based web application that allows users to sign in and manage visit logs. The application includes user authentication and role-based access to different parts of the system, such as a dashboard for monitoring visits. It utilizes a clean and modern interface built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Installation
To set up the Login System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Set up a web server**:
   Ensure you have a PHP server running. You can use tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or any other PHP server.

3. **Create a database**:
   Create a new database in your MySQL server. Import the necessary SQL tables that are referenced in the application (you will need to create these manually or use a provided SQL script).

4. **Configure database connection**:
   Update your database configuration in `config/database.php` (not provided, but referenced in the code) to set up your database credentials.

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and access the application at `http://localhost/path-to-project/index.php`.

## Usage
- **Login**: Use your credentials to log into the application.
- **Dashboard**: Once logged in, you will be directed to a dashboard where you can view visit logs based on your role. 
- **Logout**: Click on the logout link to sign out of the session and return to the login page.

## Features
- User authentication with session management.
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, security).
- Dashboard displaying visit statistics and logs.
- Dynamic form validation and error reporting for login attempts.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS for an enhanced user experience.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (imported from CDN).
- **Font Awesome** for icons (imported from CDN).
- **PHP PDO** for database interaction.

No other dependencies are explicitly listed in a `package.json` file, as this is a PHP-based application.
